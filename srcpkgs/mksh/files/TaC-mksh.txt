Terms and Conditions - The MirBSD Korn Shell
============================================

The MirBSD Korn Shell (mksh) consists of a number of "source" files,
which are provided by upstream in a number of places. This file will
list the files belonging to mksh or being part of it and the licence
terms and conditions that apply to them, in one single central place
for packagers' convenience. This list aims to be authoritative. (Yet
as it was compiled by a human, there may be bugs, please report them
if any are found. We don't think so though.)

All paths are relative to The MirOS Project's CVS repository.


The following files form The MirBSD Korn Shell R59b:
- build system
  * mksh/Build.sh
  * mksh/FAQ2HTML.sh
- testsuite driver
  * mksh/check.pl
- testsuite with code examples
  * mksh/check.t
- configuration with/and code examples (informal)
  * mksh/dot.mkshrc
  * contrib/hosted/tg/assockit.ksh
  * contrib/hosted/tg/progress-bar
  * contrib/hosted/tg/uhr
- documentation
  * mksh/lksh.1
  * mksh/mksh.1
  * mksh/mksh.faq
- source code
  * mksh/edit.c
  * mksh/emacsfn.h
  * mksh/eval.c
  * mksh/exec.c
  * mksh/expr.c
  * mksh/exprtok.h
  * mksh/funcs.c
  * mksh/histrap.c
  * mksh/jehanne.c
  * mksh/jobs.c
  * mksh/lalloc.c
  * mksh/lex.c
  * mksh/main.c
  * mksh/mirhash.h
  * mksh/misc.c
  * mksh/os2.c
  * mksh/rlimits.opt
  * mksh/sh.h
  * mksh/sh_flags.opt
  * mksh/shf.c
  * mksh/syn.c
  * mksh/tree.c
  * mksh/var.c
  * mksh/var_spec.h
- upstream provided packaging
  * mksh/mksh.ico (application icon resource)
  * mksh/Makefile (MirBSD only, not part of mksh)
  * ports/shells/mksh/DEINSTALL
  * ports/shells/mksh/DESCR (official)
  * ports/shells/mksh/INSTALL
  * ports/shells/mksh/Makefile
  * ports/shells/mksh/PLIST
  * ports/shells/mksh/distinfo (official)
  * src/distrib/special/mksh/Makefile (for the MirBSD installer)
- website (informal)
  * www/files/TaC-mksh.txt (this file)
  * www/pics/mksh.svg (logo source code)
  * www/pics/mksh128x100.png (logo compiled version)
  * www/src/mksh-faq.hts (supplemental documentation)
  * www/src/mksh.hts (primary webpage)
  * www/src/mksh_bld.hts (supplemental webpage)
  * www/src/mksh_old.hts (supplemental webpage)

All of these files are covered by The MirOS Licence (Appendix A) ex-
cept the application icon resource, the terms for that are listed in
Appendix D. Width data comes under those in Appendix E.

The creator of mksh acknowledges the contributions of several people
to the Public Domain Korn Shell as well as suggestions and work from
packagers, other developers etc. and everyone else who helped making
mksh what it is today. Thanks!  The MirBSD Korn Shell is sublicenced
under a copyright licence fallback from the original pdsh author.


The following files belong to mksh and are distributed inside of its
distfile, but are not part of it. They are provided for convenience,
because they are required on many operating environments for mksh or
some of its features to function:
- source code
  * mksh/strlcpy.c (needed if not provided by the OS already)

These files are covered by seperate licences in addition (Appendix C
for now). Some operating environments already provide their functio-
nality, such as the BSDs and OSX libc, or the Debian/freedesktop.org
libbsd package. The files are not compiled into the resulting binary
if their respective functionality is already provided.


The following file is not part of mksh but can be used with it; it's
also not included in the mksh distfile:
- source code
  * src/usr.bin/printf/printf.c (UCB printf(1) utility that has been
    slightly modified, for an optional built-in printf, to be inclu-
    ded for lksh-as-/bin/sh only and only when necessary)

The printf.c file is covered by the UCB three-clause BSD licence, as
shown in Appendix B below.


The MirOS Licence also applies as a collective-work copyright on The
MirBSD Korn Shell, an authorised derivate of the 1980s Public Domain
V7/Bourne Shell.

Note that these appendices may represent the terms and conditions of
more than one file, hence the actual wording of the files was folded
into one representation, with different copyright holders and years,
separated if merging was undesirable.

This icon may be used to refer to The MirBSD Korn Shell and
its Win32 port. Distribution patches are acceptable as long
as they modify $KSH_VERSION according to the guidelines that
are published on the website; forks and works that are not
derivates are not allowed to use it.

As far as MirBSD is concerned, the files themselves are free
to modification and distribution under BSD/MirOS Licence, the
restriction on use stems only from a need to protect it or
lose it: http://www.mckusick.com/beastie/mainpage/copyright.html

The MirOS Project may freely use the former ekkoBSD Logo,
