# About
`neko` is a WIP package manager written in POSIX shell script and (mostly) POSIX utilities inspired by VOID's `xbps-src` bash script package builder and Gentoo's portage source-based package manager. The command usage and name is inspired by Ataraxia's package manager of the same name (it means "cat" in Japanese çŒ«). The end goal is to write a package manager using POSIX shell and standard POSIX utilities found in userspaces such as suckless's sbase, GNU's Core Utils, among others (e.g. `id`, `sed`, `cut`, etc). The vision is to make it easy to write templates for like in `xbps-src` and have source based installations like portage from Gentoo.
# Installation
The `makefile` is really more for testing as this is not complete / able to be used, yet. With that in mind, the `install` rule will install the script and man page - `make install`.
## Dependencies
`neko` makes use of POSIX utilities as much as possible. However, at the moment, there are non-POSIX utilities needed to be able to run `neko`. There are two classes of dependencies so far - POSIX and non-POSIX.

POSIX:
* cksum
* sed
* printf
* echo
* common shell commands - e.g. cd, if, while, read, etc
* arithmatic expansion - $(( EXPR ))
* find
* cut
* basename
* dirname
* od (not implemented yet, but will be used for parsing files)
* dd (not implemented yet, but will be used to extract parsed files)
* eval (user for parsing / possibly extracting script)

non-POSIX:
* seq
* bit operations $(( 16 & 8 )) (might actually be POSIX - not sure)
* bit shifting (not yet implemented) - e.g. $(( 8 >> 1 ))
* GNU tar (working on replacing with od and dd commands)
* GNU wget
### On non-POSIX Dependencies
The `seq` command is technically not POSIX, but appears in pretty much every userspace I can find. It's used widely enough that I'm convinced it's worth keeping for convinience. Though, I am open to changing my mind to changing instances of `seq` to an increamenting `while` loop if presented with a good argument that `seq` isn't portable enough or it's better not to depend on it.
We are currently working on replacing GNU tar with POSIX od and dd commands. Currently, we have a working parser for gzip and one almost complete for taped archives (tar). Currently working on portable way of extracting gzip and tar format, will eventually do bz2 and xz. We are working on extracting the Huffman table from a gzip binary to use that to extract the deflate data stream. The good thing about the deflate compression method is that bz2 uses the exact same method to compress. So, once finished, all we have to do is make a parser for bz2 files and bz2 files are then done, too.
`wget` is a bit trickier to replace with POSIX commands. First, we need to write an HTTPGET request shell script to be able to request http servers for information. Then, it would be of interest to implement this in blocks such that one can resume downloads if interrupted / etc. Then, we have to write a method for performing TLS handshakes to be able to verify certificates on https servers, which is what is recommended to use now-a-days online. Then, there's FTP - which I have no idea how to do and would appreciate help if you know anything about that.
Trying to extract deflate data streams without bit shifting is, well... hard. However, bit shifting is present in all shells I've tested - bash, dash, mksh, zsh. Bit operations are, from what I can tell, essential to compare individual bits of a file to parse certain things in, for example, gzip.
### Further comments
Furthermore, just because something is POSIX doesn't mean we can expect it to be on a user's system. For example: mailx, uncompress, compress, and pax are all POSIX commands, but most of these are not commonly present on most UNIX-like systems. `neko` aims to be in that Turing Complete middle ground of POSIX and common. For that reason, you'll notice that `awk` is not used. `awk` simply isn't commonly installed on enough systems out of the box for me to justify using it, despite being a handy POSIX command. Though, I am open to changing my mind on including `awk` if it is unbelievabley appropriate / better for a certain use case.
# Usage
Start with copying the included templates to the directory where builds are done - `./neko init`. Then, try building one of the packages - `./neko pkg <pkg-name>`.
# Packages
Very similarly to VOID's package builder, `xbps-src`, every package has it's own folder in `srcpkgs` defined by its `template` file, which gives information on how to build, where to get the source, et cetera. For an example, `neko pkg st` will build based off of `srcpkgs/st/template`:
```
pkgname="st"
short_desc="Simple terminal"
version="0.8.4"
revision="1"
distfiles="https://dl.suckless.org/st/st-${version}.tar.gz"
build_style="makefile"
license="MIT"
license_file="LICENSE"
```
## Steps
Every package will go through these steps:
```
neko_prepare - prepare the enviornment for building the package and get the info from the template
neko_fetch   - get the source (currently using wget)
neko_extract - extract the source (if not using a git build)
neko_patch   - apply patches in srcpkgs/<pkgname>/patches
neko_build   - build the package
```
Those are the steps for `neko pkg <pkgname>`. If installing via `neko em <pkgname>`, the process will also invoke `neko_install`, which installs the package.
## Making a package
A quick way to make a new package is `./neko new <pkg-name>` for testing.
To make a new package for pull request, make a directory in `srcpkgs` with the `<pkgname>` - i.e. `mkdir -p srcpkgs/<pkgname>`. Then, write a file `srcpkgs/<pkgname>/template` with the following content:
```
pkgname            - the name of the package
short_desc         - short description - from the man page, README, repo, summary
version            - the version of the package (if applicable / not a git build)
revision           - changes / updates to the template without changing the version, always starts at 1
distfiles / giturl - the link to the source archive or the link to the git repo
build_style        - the way to build the package (see Build Styles section)
license            - the license that the software is released under
```
### Build Styles
Projects very often contain similar steps to build, so `build_style` is meant to simplify the process. At the moment, there are three Build Styles available that do the following at the `neko_build` phase:
```
makefile:
	make ${make_build_args}
configure:
	./configure ${configure_args}
	make ${make_build_args}
meson:
	meson build
	ninja -C build
```
These steps can be over-written in the template, as well, if the upstream package has different instructions. For example, the `bearssl` and `mksh` templates:
```
pkgname="bearssl"
short_desc="Implementation of the SSL/TLS protocol (RFC 5246) written in C"
version="0.6"
revision="1"
distfiles="https://bearssl.org/bearssl-${version}.tar.gz"
build_style="makefile"

do_install()
{
	pkg_install bin build/brssl
	pkg_install lib libbearssl.so
	pkg_install lib libbearssl.a
}

bearssl_devel_pkg()
{
	pkgname="bearssl-devel"
	short_desc="bearssl - developement files"
	do_install()
	{
		for file in inc/*
		do
			pkg_install inc "${file}"
		done
		pkg_install lib "*.so*"
		pkg_install lib "*.a"
	}
}
```
```
pkgname="mksh"
short_desc="MirBSD Korn shell"
version="R59c"
revision="1"
distfiles="http://www.mirbsd.org/MirOS/dist/mir/mksh/mksh-${version}.tgz"
wrksrc="mksh"
license="custom"
license_file="${files_dir}/TaC-mksh.txt"

do_build()
{
	sh ./Build.sh -r
}

do_install()
{
	pkg_install bin mksh
	pkg_install man mksh.1
	mv dot.mkshrc .mkshrc
	pkg_install conf .mkshrc /skel
}
```
These build styles will try and use `bmake` and `tcc` by default. If GNU `make` is needed, there are `gnu-configure` and `gnu-makefile` build styles. If `gcc` or another `CC` is needed, one can add a `CC="<c-compiler>". For example, the `musl` template:
```
pkgname="musl"
short_desc="Implementation of the standard C library"
version="1.1.24"
revision="1"
distfiles="https://musl-libc.org/releases/musl-${version}.tar.gz"
build_style="gnu-configure"
CC="gcc"
```
# Contributing
For contributing to the shell script, shellcheck is used to ensure portability. Please try and use only POSIX utilities (at the moment `wget` and `tar` are the only non-standard utilities as far as I know). When making a pull request, please make a branch with a relavent name and request to merge to the `develop` branch, unless you're making a pull request for a new package.
## Packages
**PACKAGES MUST:**
* Be able to be built against musl libc libraries
* Be able to be built against bearssl libraries

I strongly push for packages to:
* Adhere to XDG specifications (e.g. not filling up your `$HOME` folder)
* Try and be compiled with TCC (if possible) to save time on compiling

As for how to contribute, it's similar to VOID.
I love the way VOID handles pull requests for new packages, so we'll follow. When pull requesting for packages, request to merge with the master branch.
### New packages
For a new package, there should only be one commit per package with the commit message: `New package: <pkgname>-<version>`. If you're requesting a git build, please attach `-git` to the end of the package name (`srcpkgs/<pkgname>-git/template` will have `pkgname=<pkgname>-git`) with the commit message: `New package: <pkgname>-git`.
### Updating packages
For updating a package, please have the commit message be: `<pkgname>: update to <version>`.
### Patches
This is how I would recommend doing patches. Make two directories, `a` and `b`, then copy the file / files you want to patch to both. Edit the file / files in `b`. Then, `diff -Naur a/<file> b/<file> > <patch-name>.patch`. Then make a directory in `srcpkgs/<pkgname>` called `patches` and put it in there.
