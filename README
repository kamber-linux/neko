About
=====

`neko` is a package builder that is heavily inspired off of xbps from
VOID linux. Mainly just a learning experience - would love ideas / help
\~

Usage
=====

Just have a POSIX shell, and download `neko`, then try out one of the
templates.

    ./neko-src pkg bearssl

The build will be in `master/${wrksrc}` where `${wrksrc}` is the package
name and version. Clean up the master directory with `./neko-src clean`.
